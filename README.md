# Franco Reyes for VP Standalone

Hi! I'm Franco, a 3rd year computer science student and currently one of Project Directors of Freerooms alongside Bob. As you can probably guess from the heading above, I'm running for the position of VP Standalone.

## My History with DevSoc

My path into Dev (then Projects) was a rocky one.

## My Vision

- Get Freerooms, Jobsboard and Structs to the recognition level of
- CSESoc Development provides for the CSE community at UNSW, making life easier. This is an aspect I would like to focus on. Push the UNSW API project.
- Learning. Active developer community where everyone is constantly learning from one another. Continue to help foster this.
